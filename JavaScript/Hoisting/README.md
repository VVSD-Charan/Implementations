# Hoisting in JavaScript

<li>In JavaScript, Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution.</li>
<li>It gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local. </li>
<li>Hoisting allows us to call functions before even writing them in our code.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.</strong></li>


## Case 1 :

Everything works as expected because the values of variables are lready declared and function is created. <br>

## Case 2 :
<br>

This gives error in many other programming languages as we are using variables and functions even before they are defined. <br>

<strong>How this works in JavaScript?  ðŸ¤”</strong>

Well , we can get this solution by revising the execution context. In the first phase , memory creation occurs i.e memory is allocated for varibales and functions. Initially , variables are initialized as 
<strong>undefined</strong> and entire code of function is contained inside memory component.

After completion of phase 1 i.e memory creation phase , phase 2 starts where code execution occurs

##### First line of code

```

thala()

```

In memory , currently the entire function of thala is stored. The code is executed and "Thala for a reason" is printed on console. 

##### Second line of code

```

console.log(jerseyNumber);

```

Currently , in memory , the value of variable jerseyNumber is <strong>undefined</strong>. So, undefined is printed at this line.

##### Third line of code

```

var jerseyNumber = 7;

```

Now , the value of jerseyNumber in memory , which is currently undefined will be replaced by 7.

##### Fourth and remaining lines

```

function thala()
{
  console.log("Thala for a reason")
}

```

The function is already present in memory as memory allocation happens in first phase only. So, with this , the entire execution will be done and context execution will be deleted.

## Case 3 :

<li>When we use arrow functions and call the function before declaration , we get an error.</li>
<li>This is because , thala is considered as a variable in memory creation phase and is defined as undefined.</li>
<li>Calling undefined function gives an error.</li>

```

console.log(jerseyNumber);
console.log(thala);

var jerseyNumber = 7;
var thala = () =>{
    console.log("Thala for a reason");
}


```

This code will work well as thala will be undefined while it is printed.
